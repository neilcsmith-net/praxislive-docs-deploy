# Projects

The PraxisCORE architecture is driven by its own simple scripting language. However,
using _PraxisLIVE_ you don't need to know this as the project system allows you to 
build projects graphically.

_PraxisLIVE_ projects are actually folders. The configuration of each root in your
project (video patch, audio patch, control panel, etc.) is stored in a separate file.
These files have the `.pxr` file extension.

The scripts that make up a _PraxisLIVE_ project are divided into **Build Level** files
and **Run Level** files. It is important to remember that everything is edited live,
so only components that are actually installed in the hub can be edited. For this reason,
you can build a project to enable editing without needing to run it (start video / audio playback, etc.).
As you develop a project, the system tracks which files have and haven't been executed,
so that you can always build and/or run a project at any time.

It is possible to work with multiple projects concurrently, as long as there is no
collision between root ID's â€“ all root components installed within the hub at any
one time must have a unique name.

The main project folder also contains a `resources` folder. It is recommended that
you store all media required by your project in the resources folder, or a sub-folder
of it. This allows for projects to be completely self contained and makes distributing
them easier. The pop-up menu on resource folders provides an import action to copy media
into your project.

If you look at a project folder in your file browser you will also see a range of
configuration files that are normally hidden from view. Do not alter any of these.
All files that define a project are actually valid scripts, allowing for projects
to also be run using the command line player / standalone harness. When running from
the command line or standalone there is no distinction between build level and
run level files.

## Project tab

The `Projects` tab gives you the tools for opening and managing projects. Projects
are shown in a file view which shows you all the user-editable files that make up
a _PraxisLIVE_ project.

Here you can see one of the example projects opened within the projects tab, with
all folders expanded. Note the location of `.pxr` files which define different roots
(audio and video), as well as various audio and image resources.

To run a project, select it and use the buttons on the toolbar, or use the pop-up
menu on the main project folder.

To stop and clear a running project, restart the hub - you will be given the option
to save any changes. Unless you are using the (advanced) ability to work with multiple
projects, _get into the habit of restarting the hub before trying to run another project._

Double-clicking a `.pxr` file will open it in an editor window, such as the graphical patcher for audio & video.

You can create a new `.pxr` file, such as an audio or video patch, from the project's pop-up menu.
Selecting one of these options will open a wizard which will allow you to provide the root ID, which
will also be used as the name of the file.

The `Properties` option in the project's pop-up menu will open the project configuration
dialog. Within this you can control which files are included within the `Build` and `Run`
stages of a project. You can use this to control which roots auto-start, or to temporarily
ignore certain files without deleting them.
