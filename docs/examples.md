# Example projects

After installation you may want to check out some of the example projects to make
sure _PraxisLIVE_ is working correctly and check out some of its features.

The Examples section on the Start Page of the application will install the examples
as templates you can use, or you can download manually from 
[https://github.com/praxis-live/examples](https://github.com/praxis-live/examples)

## Running examples

* Ensure the examples are installed. Use the section on the Start Page, which can be reopened using
`Window/Start Page` in the main menu if closed.
* Open the new project wizard using the ![](img/newProject24.png) `New Project` button in the main toolbar.
* Browse the available example templates (use the arrows to explore sub-categories) and select the one 
you want to try; click `Next`.
* Select a project name and location; click `Finish` to create the new project.
* Highlight the project in the `Projects` tab, then click ![](img/run.png) `Run` in the main toolbar (or choose
 `Run` from the popup menu on the project).
* Editors for the various (`*.pxr`) files that make up the project will open as the example is run.
* To stop the project, use the ![](img/cleanProject24.png) `Clean` button (or choose `Clean` in the project popup
menu).

!!! info
    PraxisLIVE v5, unlike earlier versions, uses a hub per project, and so allows multiple projects to be
    run at once. A project is still active if tabs are still open or roots appear in the Hub Manager, even if all
    windows have been closed. Make sure to `Clean` the project to fully release all resources / extra processes.
