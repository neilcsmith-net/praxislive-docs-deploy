# Terminal

The Terminal window available in the Tools menu is _not_ an operating system terminal. It provides the ability to interact directly with the _PraxisLIVE_ hub and components. A useful debugging tool, it allows you to execute short scripts directly.

For example, try running the `03 audio gui` example and open the terminal. Type `/audio/filter.frequency` into the terminal and click `Run`. The filter component will respond with its frequency setting. Now try typing `/audio/filter.frequency 2000` and notice the sound change and the control panel sync to the new value.
