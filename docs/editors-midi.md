# MIDI bindings editor

MIDI `.pxr` files will open in the MIDI bindings editor. This is a simple editor
that allows you to connect MIDI controllers to any _PraxisLIVE_ control.

To **add a binding**, use the `Add` button in the editor toolbar.

Bindings are arranged in a table. You can **edit bindings** by double-clicking on
them to open the component editor, or selecting them and using the `Properties` tab.
Some properties are also editable directly within the bindings table.

Unlike GUI components, MIDI bindings do not set up their minimum and maximum values
automatically. By default they send a value from 0 to 1.

To **delete a binding**, select it and press `Delete` or use the delete button in
the editor toolbar.
